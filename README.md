# ai_dance_game
Dance game implemented using yolo8 to detect player moves with a simple camera.

The main purpose is to remove the complex, expensive and out of production Kinect device.

Current on version 0.1. It's just a proof of concept :D

I'm happy with it because at least my girlfriend liked it. Hope someone else does too!

Big thanks for the really great song!

# Future improvements:

* Make score points more fair
* Improve comparison between player pose and choreography move. It only measure distance in the current state.
* Add multi player mode
* Improve game play interface. It's too simple and not very exciting
* Improve game menus
* Add start screen
* Improve camera resolution handling
* Test with full body detection. Maybe buy a better camera
* Pack it so other people can use it.
